The weekend breezed out with a great Sunday afternoon spent with fellow Konga developers with our VP (Engineering).
He and his awesome family hosted us at his plush flat in Ikoyi. I got to play FIFA 14 on XBox with Maleek (his son)
and other devs. Great time diving and swimming in the pool too with the Lagoon in the background.

Monday doesn't feel like a workday for me. I so feel out of sync with work that I spent time writing this post.. :D
I'd probably be better of spending the day on Youtube.

I hope the week comes out good. Writing more clean codes, even though no one sees how beautiful your code is. I'm sure
whoever maintains my code will have a very low WTF rate.
